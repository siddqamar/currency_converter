# Currency Converter

This is a simple web-based currency converter application built using Streamlit. The application allows users to convert an amount from Euros, US Dollars, and British Pounds to Rupees (PKR/INR) based on user-provided exchange rates.

## Features

- Convert amounts from Euros, US Dollars, and British Pounds to Rupees.
- User-friendly interface for entering amounts and exchange rates.
- Displays converted amounts instantly.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Streamlit using pip:

## Note
